ATTACH THE PROBE!
"Prepare -> Delta Calibration - > Auto Calibration”

Check the probe is working by pushing on the probe as it descends to see if the probe retracts. then turn off and back on again.

"Prepare -> Delta Calibration - > Auto Calibration”
"Prepare -> Delta Calibration - > Set Delta Height”
"Prepare -> Delta Calibration - > Store Settings”

REMOVE THE PROBE
Prepare  -> Move Axis -> Soft Endstops Off
Prepare  -> Move Axis -> Move Z
Move the Z axis down to around 5mm and then lower until the feeler gauge won’t fit between the nozzle and the bed.

Note the distance, we will call this “A"
In my machine “A” = "-2.50”

 "Prepare -> Delta Calibration - > Delta Settings -> Height”

Note the Delta Height value “H”
“H” = 292.89

Set the New Height to “H” - “A” = 295.39 in my case.

"Prepare -> Auto Home”

“Control -> Motion -> Probe Z Offset”
Note the distance, we will call this “O”
“O” = -13.4 in my machine
My Callipers read the physical dimension of the probe at ~15.7mm at the click of the probe button.

I found that I need to ADD “A” to “O” , so…
Set the New Probe offset value to -15.9  (“O” + “A”)  (-13.4 + -2.5)

“Control - > Store Settings”

"Prepare -> Auto Home”

IF settings are not correct: Start process from “REMOVE the PROBE” again.

RE-ATTACH THE PROBE for Bed Levelling
"Prepare -> Level Bed”
“Control - > Store Settings”
"Prepare -> Auto Home”
